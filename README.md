# retro-filter-in-python
This repo contains a function I created for fun after watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWdySZ0BtJs) video from Acerola on a shader making a CRT effect.
The function edits a given image and returns an array of the color data for that image.

## retro function
The function is contained and explained in src\crt.py

## GUI
The GUI to use this function without the knowledge of how to run python can be used by opening the CRTifier.exe file in the dist folder
